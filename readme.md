## 0. Overview

This repository contains materials for the ADSA NANP Modeling Workshop on Model Validation. The workshop is designed to offer a hands-on introduction to the prevalent risks in evaluating predictive models. We will run through several simulations to demonstrate the importance of model validation and answer the following questions:

- Why is it necessary to split our data into training and testing sets for model validation?
- How do we validate a model that includes hyperparameters?
- How does splitting the data based on different experimental factors influence our conclusions in model validation?

## 1. Environment Setup

Please make sure to set up your environment before the workshop. You can choose to run the workshop materials on your local machine or on Anaconda Cloud.

### 1.1 Option 1 (recommended): Run on your local machine

To ensure the best quality of this workshop and to avoid any internet connectivity issues, we recommend that you run the workshop materials on your local machine. To do so, you will need to install Python and Jupyter Notebook, which is an interactive coding environment, on your machine.

#### Step 1: Install Anaconda Distribution

Anaconda is the easiest way to get started with Python and Jupyter Notebook. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/ to download the Anaconda distribution and install it on your machine. You DO NOT need to change any settings during the installation.

#### Step 2: Clone the workshop repository


### 1.2 Option 2: Run on Anaconda Cloud
